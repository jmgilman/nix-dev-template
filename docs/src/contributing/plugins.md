# Plugins

Contributing plugins to Nixago is a multi-step process. Fortunately, the design
of Nixago makes these steps relatively straightforward.

## Checklist

The following is a helpful checklist to go over before submitting a PR:

1. Is the plugin named after the tool it supports?
2. Does the plugin have a dedicated directory under [plugins][1]?
3. Was the plugin added to the main [default.nix][2]?
4. Does the plugin have tests written for it?
5. Have the tests been added to the [flake.nix][3] `checks` output?
6. Does the plugin have a dedicated page in the documentation?

If you answered yes to all of the above questions, you are ready to submit a PR!

## Creating a Plugin

Creating a plugin encompasses three primary tasks:

1. Create a CUE file
2. Create the Nix functions
3. Write tests and documentation

You should isolate each plugin to a dedicated directory under [plugins][1]. The
first step is to create a new directory with the plugin's name. The name should
ideally indicate the tool that it supports (i.e., the plugin for the Prettier
formatter is called `prettier`).

The remainder of this section will walk through creating a plugin for the
[pre-commit][4] CLI tool. The plugin will generate a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
file to configure the pre-commit tool.

### Creating the CUE file

Review the [CUE section](design.md#cue) of the design page for more information
about CUE. Each plugin typically utilizes a single CUE file, although more
advanced cases may require multiple files. The file should be called
`template.cue`.

When creating the CUE file, keep the following in mind:

- The schema defined in the file should be sufficient to prevent most
  configuration mistakes.

- If the supported tool has rich documentation around valid values for each
  configuration field, use constraints to improve the accuracy of the schema.

- Don't be overly strict with the schema definition. The goal is to be helpful
  and not generate many false negatives.

Here is the `template.nix` file for our pre-commit plugin:

```cue
#Config: {
    default_install_hook_types?: [...string]
    default_language_version?: [string]: string
    default_stages?: [...string]
    files?: string
    exclude?: string
    fail_fast?: bool
    minimum_pre_commit_version?: string
    repos: [...#Repo]
}

#Hook: {
    additional_dependencies?: [...string]
    alias?: string
    always_run?: bool
    args?: [...string]
    entry?: string
    exclude?: string
    exclude_types?: [...string]
    files?: string
    id: string
    language?: string
    language_version?: string
    log_file?: string
    name?: string
    stages?: [...string]
    types?: [...string]
    types_or?: [...string]
    verbose?: bool
}

#Repo: {
    repo: string
    rev?: string
    if repo != "local" {
        rev: string
    }
    hooks: [...#Hook]
}

{
    #Config
}
```

This file defines three [definitions][5], notated by the `#` symbol. A
definition is synonymous with a schema or contract. It describes the shape of
valid data through various constraints. Let's break one down:

```cue
#Repo: {
    repo: string
    rev?: string
    if repo != "local" {
        rev: string
    }
    hooks: [...#Hook]
}
```

The `pre-commit-config.yaml` file has a `repos` field which is a list of
repositories that pre-commit should build from. The `#Repo` definition provides
the schema for these entries. Each entry must have a `repo` field which is a
string value. The `rev` field is interesting: it's only optional if the `repo`
field is set to "local". The above sets the `rev` field to optional using the
`?` symbol and then conditonally sets it to required based on the value of
`repo`. Finally, each entry has a list of hooks, denoted by the `[...#Hooks]`
syntax.

```cue
{
    #Config
}
```

This final bit is where we define the elements of the CUE file. This is what
will appear when we evaluate the CUE file. In the above case, we're saying the
input data should be a [struct][6] that conforms to the schema defined by
`#Config`.

We're doing no additional transformations to the incoming data in this case. We
expect the input data to be in the format defined in the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Since YAML is a superset of JSON, we can easily
ask CUE to evaluate the input and produce a YAML output.

### Creating the Nix Functions

With the CUE file created, the next step is to make our primary Nix function. We
will create a single function for generating our configuration file:

```nix
{ pkgs, lib }:
{ configData }:
with pkgs.lib;
let
  files = [ ./template.cue ];
  output = ".pre-commit-config.yaml";
  pre-commit = pkgs.pre-commit;

  # Add an extra hook for reinstalling required stages whenever the file changes
  stages = unique (flatten
    (builtins.map
      (repo: builtins.map
        (hook: optionals (hook ? stages) hook.stages)
        repo.hooks)
      configData.repos) ++ [ "pre-commit" ]);
  stagesStr = builtins.concatStringsSep " " stages;
  shellHookExtra =
    (import ./common.nix { inherit pre-commit stagesStr; }).shellHookExtra;

  # Generate the module
  result = lib.mkTemplate {
    inherit configData files output shellHookExtra;
  };
in
{
  inherit (result) configFile shellHook;
}
```

All functions maintain the same basic structure. At the top, we accept an
attribute set as the first argument, which pulls in local copies of `nixpkgs`
and the internal `lib` provided by the flake. The second argument should also be
an attribute set that must contain the `configData` attribute. Nixago expects
all plugin functions to take a single attribute set as an argument that, at the
very least, contains the `configData` attribute. The `configData` attribute is
where the raw incoming data from the end user is placed.

It's possible to add additional arguments to the attribute set if your plugin
requires extra configuration. Ensure that you provide ample documentation for
each of these additional arguments to the end user.

The top of the function should declare the `files` and `output` variables. The
`files` variable should point to the CUE file we previously created. The
`output` variable should contain the name of the configuration file the plugin
is generating. Note that the extension of the configuration file is essential.
CUE uses the file extension to determine what format to output when CUE
evaluates the file. [See here][7] for supported formats.

The remainder of the function is specific to each plugin. In the case above, we
gather all pre-commit `stages` to determine what stages of the pre-commit
process will be installed when the configuration is generated. We then create
`shellHookExtra`, which contains the necessary logic for installing the stages.

We call the internal `mkTemplate` at the very end. For more details about this
function, [see here](design.md#templates).

We must take two additional steps for our plugin to be picked up by the flake.
The first is creating a `default.nix` in our plugin directory that exports our
function:

```nix
{ pkgs, lib }:
rec {
  default = mkConfig;

  /* Creates a .pre-commit-config.yaml file for configuring pre-commit.
  */
  mkConfig = import ./mkConfig.nix { inherit pkgs lib; };
}
```

This will allow the `mkConfig` function to be accessible under
`nixago.plugins.{myPlugin}.mkConfig`. Setting the `default` attribute is
recommended; otherwise, the plugin may not play well with the `mkAll` function.
You should set it to the most widely used function.

Finally, we must create an entry in the main `default.nix`:

```nix
{ pkgs, lib }:
{
  # ...

  /* https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit
  */
  pre-commit = import ./pre-commit { inherit pkgs lib; };

  # ....
}
```

This function registers the plugin to make it accessible from `nixago.plugins`.

### Writing Tests and Documentation

The final step is to write tests and documentation for the plugin. Tests live in
the [tests][8] directory in a dedicated directory named after the plugin. Tests
are relatively trivial to write.

The first step is to create a `default.nix` which runs the test:

```nix
{ runTest }:
runTest "pre-commit.mkConfig" ./expected.yml {
  repos = [
    {
      repo = "https://github.com/my/repo";
      rev = "1.0";
      hooks = [
        {
          id = "my-hook";
        }
      ];
    }
  ];
}
{ }

```

The `runTest` helper function provided performs most of the underlying work
required to test the plugin. It takes four arguments: the function to call for
the test, the location of the expected test output, the data to pass to the
specified function, and any additional arguments to pass to the plugin function.

The second step is to create the expected output. In this case, the above
invocation should produce the following result:

```yaml
repos:
  - hooks:
      - id: my-hook
    repo: https://github.com/my/repo
    rev: "1.0"
```

The expected result is compared to the generated output, and the test will fail
if there is a difference.

The final step is to add the test to the `checks` output in the `default.nix`
file located at the root of the tests directory:

```nix
{
  # ...
  pre-commit = pkgs.callPackage ./pre-commit { inherit runTest; };
  # ...
}
```

Finally, before submitting a PR, add documentation under the [plugins][9]
section of the documentation. Ensure you cover general usage information about
the plugin, including an example invocation.
